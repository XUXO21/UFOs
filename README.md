## 3. Summary

Webpage is functional and help us to make searches and filter as needed but there are some drawbacks; fisrt, you have to input the date with the format and we don't have a clear reference of the earliest and latest dates to search. If we could have a menu wuth starting and end date and be able to scroll down first year, then month and finally day ir would improve a lot the UX.

### Recommendation:

1. Add drop down menus with the names of the coutries and cities to make an easiear search.

2. Include other variables on the search like sighting duration, if it has Audiovisual material and a link to see it.
